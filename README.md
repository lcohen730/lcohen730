### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a recent coding bootcamp graduate and React enthusiast.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Next.js tutorial so I can incorporate Next.js into my future full-stack applications.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data structures and algorithms on Interview Cake, and I am listening to the podcast "Syntax", hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any of my repositories as well as any project you may want some help on!

âš¡ Fun fact: I know 24 digits of pi by heart for no reason.
